# AICON

Aspherical Interface Constructor for Nanoparticles (AICON), is a tool for analyzing molecular dynamics trajectories. It allows constructing an interface between two phases, enabling to calculate intrinsic density profiles, volumes, etc.

The interface construction works for spherical and rod-like nanoparticles equally well, making it a great tool to work with nanoparticles of almost every shape.
